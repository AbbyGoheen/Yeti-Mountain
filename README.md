# Yeti Mountain – Starter

This folder contains a ready-to-upload starter for your GitHub Pages site.

## Files you have
- `index.html` – the game page
- Placeholder images: `mountain.png`, `yeti1.png`, `yeti2.png`, `yeti3.png`, `yeti4.png`  
  Replace these with your real artwork (keep the same filenames).

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new **public** repo on GitHub (e.g., `Yeti-Mountain`).
2. Upload *all* files from this starter (index.html + images) to the repo **root**.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Set **Branch** to `main` and **/(root)**, then Save.
6. Your site will be available at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`.

## Replace images
- Put your real `mountain.png` and `yeti1..4.png` in the repo root.
- Keep the same filenames so the code works without edits.
